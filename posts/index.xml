      <description>Introduction First of all, the major wrapper library, which was called discord.py, for developing discord bots in python is currently being discontinued. You can see a full depth in-detail description by the project author in this gist linked below. Sadly though, yea.

The last discord.</description>

 OpenDNS is an American company providing Domain Name System (DNS) resolution services—with features such as phishing protection, optional content filtering, and DNS lookup in its DNS servers—and a cloud computing security product suite, Umbrella, designed to protect enterprise customers from malware, botnets, phishing, and targeted online attacks.</description>
