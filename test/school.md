# Discord.

Good Morning ma'am.

I'm Senuka Bandara from Grade 10. I have this suggestion I'd like to bring up. It's regarding an app that's called **[Discord](https://discord.com)**.

This is just an idea so, in this page I'd like to introduce what discord is, what it can do, and, why did I think of this idea.

## What is discord?

*Discord* is an app that has been designed for users to communicate with each other in a more categorized manner.

But, this app's main interest was targeted towards gamers. But still, with it's development over a long time, many organizations joined discord because of it's flexibility.

Discord has many features that might be useful to our school too.

I'll get straight into the features that might come out useful. Again, this is just an experimental idea.

### What are the features of Discord?

> Categorized Text Channels.

   > What are Categorized Text Channels?

These are basically text channels but we can create as much as we want with a name, topic, etc in the same group(server).

Here's an example on what text channels looks like:

![text channels](/assets/text_channels.png) 

ðŸ”´ - **Categories**

ðŸ”µ - **Channels**

Like in the example above, we can create channels based on a specific category.

If, every student in the school joined the server. We can create categories for each class. And for each category create a separate channel for announcements, sending timetables, discussions per subject etc.

> But if the whole school is in this server, are the other categories and channels that are not relevant to the student also visible?

Simply, no. We can create something called ***roles*** (which I will talking about soon) and apply them to people. Using these we can make per channel not visible/visible. Because of this advantage we can create private channels. For teacher discussions, student-teacher meetings, assignment sharing(only the teacher and the specific student can see.)

The main thing I thought about discord is direct contact. Students can directly be in contact with teachers with matters. Of course, it is possible using Microsoft Teams too(this sometimes can be a painful process). But, I'm gonna be introducting a feature called voice channels that enables people to join and talk at any time. 

See below:

> Voice Channels.

Voice channels are similar to Text Channels, but instead, as you might've guessed, we can share voice. 

The main advantage is if a student has a problem with a specific matter in a subject, he/she can ask a teacher directly. Then, when the teacher is available, they can contact the student using a voice channel in the server itself. Here's what a voice channel looks like:


![Voice Channel](/assets/vc.png)

Right now, I have connected to the Main | Lounge Voice channel. Many people can join/leave when they want. So, the point here is it's really easy for communication in small matters. There is no need to setup meetings for a small question of a student.

Quick subject matter discussion facility!

>Roles

Roles are like badges we can assign to different people for identification. For example, we can create roles for a teacher as 'Teacher', and give that teacher more roles stating the subject they teach etc.

The use of roles is however, we can use them to hide channels, give permissions, etc.

For students, we can assign roles according to their Index Number. If one account has 2 people(sibilings in the same school), we can assign both the roles so that account can see both the student's relevant channels.

Here's what roles looks like in an order [EXAMPLE].

![Roles](/assets/roles.png)

Here's different roles for one person:

![Roles2](/assets/roles2.png)

After assigning the different roles, my profile would look like this. (This is an example teacher profile.)


> Bots

A wonderful feature in this app is the ability to create automated programs called 'bots'. These bots can be created by coding the required instructions. I personally have a hobby of developing stuff and I'll give my best to create a bot.

A bot is essentially like a user account, but we can feed instructions to it. So, human effort can be minimized to be controlled by this bot.

Bots have something called commands. They just work simply. When we enter the command it returns us a desired output.

I've already got an idea to create a submit command to submit homeworks/assigments. When a student enters a command what it'll basically do is:

1. Create a temporary Text Channel that's private (only the student and the bot can see).
2. Wait for the student to upload all his/her homework as an image or typed message.
3. When the student is done, delete that private channel and send all the assignments to the relevant subject teacher with the student name, date, time, etc.

Using bots, we can make our tasks easier. For example, if a teacher wanted to warn a student, they could do `.warn @studentname` and it'll send a warning or whatever we want it to do.

> Stage Channels

This is a different type of channel and we can use these channels to hold meetings. Big meetings for example, parent meetings with teachers. Or,  Principal to Parents, etc.

In this type of channel, there can be a lot of people. Only the presenters can talk. The presenters can make people in the audience be able to talk when they want to. The audience has a raise hand feature too, so we know when the audience wants to speak.

Stage channels looks like:

![Stage Channel](/assets/stage_channel.jpg)

* The presenters are at the top, and they can speak.
* The audience is at the bottom listening to the presenters.


## To sum up the features that can be useful as a community.

Maybe, this might feel too complex. The ups are higher than the downs. It's all managed. It's all categorized. Also, once madam installs the app, it'll be so easy to understand. This text might be hard to understand because I can't showcase everything. Anyways here's what the interface looks like in a computer:

![Interface](/assets/interface.png)

One thing I like is announcements. For example, when we're using WhatsApp and we want to send out a global announcement, we have to manually forward the announcement to each group per class. But, because we have the ability to create a global text channel that everybody in the server can see in Discord, madam can just type it out by mentioning everyone.

Pro tip: To mention everyone in the server, you can do `@everyone` and it will send a notification to everyone in the server.

However though, this is just an idea and of course, we can continue using WhatsApp. And, I'm just giving Discord as an alternative to WhatsApp because of it's features. I do not recommend hosting class meetings in Discord. We can continue using Teams. Discord will just give life to easy contact and communication facilities,

...assignment sharing and much more.

> The Complexity?

Well, that's a problem we might have to consider, if we considered using Discord like that. The best feature of all is that we can put all the classes inside on server, without creating separate groups for each class in WhatsApp.

If, we considered using Discord, we can create a video demo and send out to the groups on how to use Discord.

It's pretty straightforward. All a person has to do is create an account (just like how anybody would create an account in any other app), and join using a link to the server.

The bot that I would be creating if we used Discord is gonna handle accounts. Like, when a new student joins the server, they will be asked to enter their admission number and that's it. It's all setup automatically.

**This is just a suggestion. If madam saw any issue with this app, please feel free to ask me on how to resolve it. Please keep me updated on madam's decision. Thank you madam.**
