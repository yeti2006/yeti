[{"body":" Hello. \nI\u0026rsquo;m a young tryna be developer that loves creating various useless stuff.\nMy main language is Python and I\u0026rsquo;m currently tryna learn C#\nI code as a hobby in my free time and I\u0026rsquo;m decently bad at it.\nHere are a few facts about me:\n I hate myself I hate myself I really love hugs I hate myself  You can check out my projects in the projects section on the left or you can just click right through:\nGo2Projecz Add Yeti#2222 on discord!\n","link":"http://yeti.ga/","title":"Home"},{"body":"Welcome to my projects! As free time is a resource I lack I can\u0026rsquo;t keep up. There are only a few projects, I hope you like them!Leave a star on the repo if you like it.\n(Yes, refactoring is required)\n","link":"http://yeti.ga/docs.html","title":"Projects"},{"body":"Welcome to SpotiLike My favourite project of em all.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re looking for my first attempt in this project(the one which requires config file typing), I suggest you head over to Version 1\nDownload SpotiLike Source Repo What is SpotiLike? SpotiLike is a simple application that allows you to configure custom keyboard shortcuts(hotkeys), that\u0026rsquo;s gonna let you add songs to your private playlists, or your own personal liked songs library in Spotify, while you\u0026rsquo;re listening to them.\nDoesn\u0026rsquo;t make sense?\nOk, imagine you\u0026rsquo;re gaming whilst listening to Spotify, then a track that\u0026rsquo;s of your deep interest comes to view. You may want to save that track to a custom playlist or just like it -\u0026gt; to add to your Liked Songs library. Returning to the Spotify application could be troublesome and annoying.\nTo overcome this, this application might be your aid; you can save them with your keyboard!\nBut\u0026hellip;why? I created this project cause' I needed a way to save my songs as a collection with my keyboard, without returning to the Spotify application while listening.\nAs Spotify itself doesn\u0026rsquo;t provide this functionality, I tried to find a solution.. but, I didn\u0026rsquo;t find a solution that matched my requirements so I attempted to come up with my own.\nThe reason I found this annoying is because returning to the Spotify application interrupted my workflow, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to miss that cool song too ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\nThis might come in handy if you\u0026rsquo;re a gamer and loves music.\nHow2Use The application is pretty straight forward. All you gotta do is type out your hotkey with + as the separator.\nAfter installation when you first start the app after authorizing your account, it would look like:\nThe application is now in a state of fetching all of your private playlists. Once that is done, you will be able to see all of your playlists when you click the drop down.\nPlease note that it might take some time for the application to start the first time you open it. It attempts to download all the icons of your playlists. Well, this depends mostly on your interent connection.\r\rAlso keep in mind to not close the application when it\u0026rsquo;s fetching. This is a bug that I didn\u0026rsquo;t fix (sorry)\r\rConfiguring the hotkeys And now, all you have to do is type out your hotkey using \u0026ldquo;+\u0026rdquo; as the separator.\nFor instance, if you want to like your current playing song when you press ctrl and l together, the value would be ctrl+l selecting Saved Songs in the drop down.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s what I use to save a song to my playlist named Chill:\nClosing the application would automatically save it to the System Tray. Wanna get it back again or close it? Right click the tray icon and you\u0026rsquo;ll see a list of options.\r\rSettings The settings page consists of 4 options, namely:\n Fetch All your playlists Fetch Songs on startup Show notifications Auto Like With playlists     Setting Description     Fetch All your playlists This option is enabled by default. Fetches all your private playlists from the API. If you don\u0026rsquo;t wish to enable hotkeys for playlists and just your Liked songs library, consider disabling this setting. (Faster startup: if disabled)   Fetch Songs on startup This option would fetch the first 100 tracks from each of your private playlists. This would allow the application to prevent creating duplicate saves for a track in the same playlist. Due to a Spotify limitation, if you save a song in a playlist that has that specific song, there would be a duplicate. (Faster startup: if disabled)   Show notifications Allow or disable notifications, when you do a hotkey.   Auto Like With playlists Save the song to your liked songs library when you save to a playlist, automatically. If you saved the song to x playlist and you want the song to automatically get saved to your library Liked songs library too, consider enabling this option.    Startup\nWhen you install the application, the app would automatically register itself as a start up application. This means it would open itself when you log in to Windows.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t like startup apps? You can disable it by opening Task Manager: navigate to the startup tab, find SpotiLike, right click and disable.\nAvailable Keys The hotkeys can be literally anything you want. Even a+b works.\nBelow given are a list of keys that are available so far.\nalt\rbackspace\rcaps_lock\rctrl cmd delete down end enter esc f1 f10 f11 f12 f13 f14 f15 f16 f17 f18 f19 f2\rf20\rf3\rf4\rf5\rf6\rf7\rf8\rf9\rhome\rinsert\rleft\rmedia_next\rmedia_play_pause\rmedia_previous\rmedia_volume_down\rmedia_volume_mute\rmedia_volume_up\rmenu\rnum_lock\rpage_down\rpage_up\rpause\rprint_screen\rright\rscroll_lock\rshift\rspace\rtab\rup\rI can\u0026rsquo;t find media_next keys in my keyboard..help! Those keys have special functions. Most keyboards have the functionality to skip the current playing song using a function key. F5 and F6 in most keyboards act as them. Even some headphones have this functionality too. You can specify these too so you can maybe save songs using your headset? Iunno.\nTo avoid possible errors, when you enter a key as a hotkey the application goes through a matching process to match to the nearest existing key. For instance, if you type ct+l the application would error internally as a key called \u0026lsquo;ct\u0026rsquo; doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist. The closest match would be ctrl so the application would take it as ctrl+l internally.TL;DR: ct+l works as ctrl+l.\r\r","link":"http://yeti.ga/docs/spotilike_/spotilike.html","title":"SpotiLike"},{"body":"Undocumented, coming soon. use version 2 lol\n:)\n","link":"http://yeti.ga/docs/spotilike_/spotilikev1.html","title":"SpotiLike v1"}]
