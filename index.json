In case you didn\u0026rsquo;t know, OpenDNS is a service that offers you a custom DNS service to block unwanted connections from your network.\n OpenDNS is an American company providing Domain Name System (DNS) resolution services—with features such as phishing protection, optional content filtering, and DNS lookup in its DNS servers—and a cloud computing security product suite, Umbrella, designed to protect enterprise customers from malware, botnets, phishing, and targeted online attacks. The OpenDNS Global Network processes an estimated 100 billion DNS queries daily from 85 million users through 25 data centers worldwide. -Wikipedia\n You can use OpenDNS to disable access to certain networks. Such as websites or categories of websites, well, let\u0026rsquo;s call it content filtering.\nOpenDNS is also known to have zero downtime because of the global network of DNS servers it covers.\nHow does this work? The websites you visit thoughout the day are actually IP addresses behind the scenes. Domain names such as www.youtube.com point to an IP address which you will access as a simple name that\u0026rsquo;s easy to remember. To eliminate the need of remembering IP addresses, DNS servers are useful.\nEvery device in the interent has an IP address. This is like their identity in a computer-friendly way. Your client performs a request to a DNS server to return the IP address of where you want to go according to the domain you entered. If the DNS server finds the record, it returns the specific IP address for you to access where you want to go.\nThis is basically how it works.\nWhy would you want to use it? Speed, reliability and much.\nIf you want to block people from visiting certain sites and/or categories, you can easily set it up on your router and have complete control over your network in a really simple way.\nThis could be really useful if you have kids- but that\u0026rsquo;s not the point here huh\u0026hellip; to block it\nSo, why block it and how? As amazing as this is, this might not be as cool for everyone. I don\u0026rsquo;t recommend attempting to bypass this if it\u0026rsquo;s blocked for a reason\u0026hellip; But anyways:\n Just change DNS.\n That\u0026rsquo;s all you have to do, although there are other methods.\nI recommend using Google\u0026rsquo;s Public DNS which is,\n8.8.8.8\r8.8.4.4 Assuming you probably don\u0026rsquo;t have access to your router, change it in your machine itself.\n Switch to a public DNS Use a VPN Use a Proxy site Use a browser like Tor   1. Switch to a different DNS ‣ Windows This method is how I recommend it, plus it\u0026rsquo;s reliable.\nIf you are on a Windows PC, follow these steps:\n  Open Control Panel\n navigate to Control Panel\\Network and Internet\\Network and Sharing Center and click on Change Adapter settings.      Right click your network, and go to properties.\n  Select “Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCIP/IPv4)” in the list and click “Properties”.\n  Check \u0026ldquo;Use the following DNS server addresses, enter the addresses of the DNS servers you want to use\u0026rdquo;.\n   Enter the addresses of the DNS servers you want to use and click Ok.  You may also want to clear the DNS cache. For this: open a command prompt window as Adminstrator and run: ipconfig /flushdns\r\rAnd, that\u0026rsquo;s it! You\u0026rsquo;re now free from OpenDNS.\n‣ Android  Head over to your WiFi settings and tap \u0026ldquo;Modify network\u0026rdquo; or the closest match to that.  There you can change your DNS.\nA good resource: https://www.howtogeek.com/167533/the-ultimate-guide-to-changing-your-dns-server/\nㅤ\n2. Use a VPN You can use a VPN alternatively. A VPN stands for \u0026ldquo;Virtual Private Network\u0026rdquo; which disguises your IP through a data tunnel which comes out from various servers from around the world.\nMost of the times a VPN would assign a separate DNS server throughout your session, just make sure your choice of VPN does.\nIf you care about privacy alot, I suggest you use a VPN since it\u0026rsquo;s safe that way to surf the interent without being tracked in any way.\nㅤ\n3. Use a Proxy site I don\u0026rsquo;t recommend this one. A proxy site is like a website that allows you to access blocked websites.\nWhat it essentially does is, it requests for the address you asked for in a proxy tunnel and receives back the data through that same tunnel. Hence, it\u0026rsquo;s not blocked anymore.\nYou can Learn more here\nHowever, there are limitations to this method. OpenDNS blocks almost all of these sites by default. This is also less secure since it can track your history.\nHere are a list of some proxy sites:\n https://hidemyass.com https://proxysite.com https://Kproxy.com https://hola.org  ㅤ\n4. Use a portable browser You can also use a super secure browser alternatively. The most popular out there is the Tor browser.\nTor browser\u0026rsquo;s main point is privacy. It is designed to prevent 3rd party trackers from tracking your online activity. You can read more on their official website:\nwww.torproject.org\n(You can install this browser into a flash drive and use it acccordingly)\n Thanks for reading!

As free time is a resource I lack I can\u0026rsquo;t keep up. There are only a few projects, I hope you like them!Leave a star on the repo if you like it.\n(Yes, refactoring is required)\nCheck out SpotiLike\n","link":"https://yeti-is-god.ml/docs/","title":"Projects"},{"body":"Welcome to SpotiLike My favourite project of em all.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re looking for my first attempt in this project(the one which requires config file typing), I suggest you head over to Version 1\nDownload SpotiLike Source Repo YouTube video \r\rWhat is SpotiLike? SpotiLike is a simple application that allows you to configure custom keyboard shortcuts(hotkeys), that\u0026rsquo;s gonna let you add songs to your private playlists, or your own personal liked songs library in Spotify, while you\u0026rsquo;re listening to them.\nDoesn\u0026rsquo;t make sense?\nOk, imagine you\u0026rsquo;re gaming whilst listening to Spotify, then a track that\u0026rsquo;s of your deep interest comes to view. You may want to save that track to a custom playlist or just like it -\u0026gt; to add to your Liked Songs library. Returning to the Spotify application could be troublesome and annoying.\nTo overcome this, this application might be your aid; you can save them with your keyboard!\nBut\u0026hellip;why? I created this project cause' I needed a way to save my songs as a collection with my keyboard, without returning to the Spotify application while listening.\nAs Spotify itself doesn\u0026rsquo;t provide this functionality, I tried to find a solution.. but, I didn\u0026rsquo;t find a solution that matched my requirements so I attempted to come up with my own.\nThe reason I found this annoying is because returning to the Spotify application interrupted my workflow, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to miss that cool song too ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\nThis might come in handy if you\u0026rsquo;re a gamer and loves music.\nHow2Use The application is pretty straight forward. All you gotta do is type out your hotkey with + as the separator.\nAfter installation when you first start the app after authorizing your account, it would look like:\nThe application is now in a state of fetching all of your private playlists. Once that is done, you will be able to see all of your playlists when you click the drop down.\nPlease note that it might take some time for the application to start the first time you open it. It attempts to download all the icons of your playlists. Well, this depends mostly on your interent connection.\r\rAlso keep in mind to not close the application when it\u0026rsquo;s fetching. This is a bug that I didn\u0026rsquo;t fix (sorry) It\u0026rsquo;s fixed!\r\rConfiguring the hotkeys And now, all you have to do is type out your hotkey using \u0026ldquo;+\u0026rdquo; as the separator.\nFor instance, if you want to like your current playing song when you press ctrl and l together, the value would be ctrl+l selecting Saved Songs in the drop down.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s what I use to save a song to my playlist named Chill:\nClosing the application would automatically save it to the System Tray. Wanna get it back again or close it? Right click the tray icon and you\u0026rsquo;ll see a list of options.\r\rSettings The settings page consists of 4 options, namely:\n Fetch All your playlists Fetch Songs on startup Show notifications Auto Like With playlists     Setting Description     Fetch All your playlists This option is enabled by default. Fetches all your private playlists from the API. If you don\u0026rsquo;t wish to enable hotkeys for playlists and just your Liked songs library, consider disabling this setting. (Faster startup: if disabled)   Fetch Songs on startup This option would fetch the first 100 tracks from each of your private playlists. This would allow the application to prevent creating duplicate saves for a track in the same playlist. Due to a Spotify limitation, if you save a song in a playlist that has that specific song, there would be a duplicate. (Faster startup: if disabled)   Show notifications Allow or disable notifications, when you do a hotkey.   Auto Like With playlists Save the song to your liked songs library when you save to a playlist, automatically. If you saved the song to x playlist and you want the song to automatically get saved to your library Liked songs library too, consider enabling this option.    Startup\nWhen you install the application, the app would automatically register itself as a start up application. This means it would open itself when you log in to Windows.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t like startup apps? You can disable it by opening Task Manager: navigate to the startup tab, find SpotiLike, right click and disable.\nAvailable Keys The hotkeys can be literally anything you want. Even a+b works.\nBelow given are a list of keys that are available so far.\nalt\rbackspace\rcaps_lock\rctrl cmd delete down end enter esc f1 f10 f11 f12 f13 f14 f15 f16 f17 f18 f19 f2\rf20\rf3\rf4\rf5\rf6\rf7\rf8\rf9\rhome\rinsert\rleft\rmedia_next\rmedia_play_pause\rmedia_previous\rmedia_volume_down\rmedia_volume_mute\rmedia_volume_up\rmenu\rnum_lock\rpage_down\rpage_up\rpause\rprint_screen\rright\rscroll_lock\rshift\rspace\rtab\rup\r+ the alphabet.\rI can\u0026rsquo;t find media_next keys in my keyboard..help! Those keys have special functions. Most keyboards have the functionality to skip the current playing song using a function key. F5 and F6 in most keyboards act as them. Even some headphones have this functionality too. You can specify these too so you can maybe save songs using your headset? Iunno.\nTo avoid possible errors, when you enter a key as a hotkey the application goes through a matching process to match to the nearest existing key. For instance, if you type ct+l the application would error internally as a key called \u0026lsquo;ct\u0026rsquo; doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist. The closest match would be ctrl so the application would take it as ctrl+l internally.TL;DR: ct+l works as ctrl+l.\r\r","link":"https://yeti-is-god.ml/docs/spotilike_/v2/spotilike/","title":"SpotiLike"},{"body":"Hi! This is my first attempt in creating \u0026ldquo;an app that would let you save Spotify songs using your keyboard with a custom keyboard shortcut.\u0026rdquo;\nIt\u0026rsquo;ll be great if you use version 2 since this is boring :/\nSpotiLike v1 I\u0026rsquo;ll be going through how to use this only, why and what can be learned if you head over here.\nConfiguration After installation, the app would auto minimize itself to the System Tray. You can then access the config.ini file by:\n right-clicking the icon in the system tray clicking on config  This would open up a file in your prefered text editor, most likely Notepad.\nIf the app fails to open the file, or even if you did open it, fails to save the file: you\u0026rsquo;re running into a permissions error. Re-run the app in adminstrator mode or just move the app location to somewhere like your Documents library to fix this.\r\rKey-values When you first open the file it would look like this:\n[Liked Songs] key=ctrl+l auto_like_for_playlist=yes # Good luck! Each entry inside a [] block would count as a playlist.\nAfter you define your playlist inside [] put two values below it namely,\n key - hotkey playlist - playlist url  Have a look at this example:\n[Liked Songs] key=ctrl+l auto_like_for_playlist=yes [My really awesome playlist] key=alt+1 playlist=https://open.spotify.com/playlist/586XcIMqh10SsxAT3GBm6j [Second cool playlist] key=alt+2 playlist=https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1923kljlkadsnlcasdlad [Wait another PLaylist?] key=ctrl+shift+f playlist=https://open.spotify.com/playlist/01HZ3A9NxKJNcKg6BPNOR6 When you save the config file, the app would auto reload itself.\nAll you gotta do is press the hotkeys now and it\u0026rsquo;s gonna show a notification to notify you that the song succesfully saved.\nNOTE: The auto_like_for_playlist is \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo; by default. You can change it to \u0026ldquo;no\u0026rdquo; if you don\u0026rsquo;t want songs auto added to your liked songs library when adding a song to a playlist.\r\rThe playlist name you write inside [] would be shown in the notification when saving despite the actual playlist name.\r\rIcons 🌈 Yes\nThe default icon is a super ugly ℹ icon :/ You can have a custom icon per playlist you create in your config.ini.\nNOTE: You should have your image as a .ico file. You can find plenty of sites online that converts your image file to a .ico for you.\r\rIn the Tray menu, go ahead and click the Icons 🌈 option. This will open a folder which by default contains 3 icon files.\n Grab your .ico file and copy it to the folder. Rename it to the name you defined your playlist in the config file. (Example; if you did My Awesome Playlist the .ico file name should be My Awesome Playlist too.)  You can also replace the default 3 icons with whatever you like. Just make sure they\u0026rsquo;re there and you don\u0026rsquo;t accidentally delete them since they\u0026rsquo;re required. They should be .ico files too!\r\rStartup Wait, can I make this open on startup somehow?\nYes. Follow these steps below:\n Hold windows key + R In the Run dialog that appears, type shell:startup. Paste the SpotiLike shortcut in the folder that appears.  Congratulations you made it to the end. Say Hi? Add me on Discord! Yeti#4594\nThis project was mostly based on my personal need. It probably might be useless for alot of people, but if you find it useful however feel free to install it and send me a virtual hug.\nThanks.\n","link":"https://yeti-is-god.ml/docs/spotilike_/v1/spotilikev1/","title":"SpotiLike v1"}]
