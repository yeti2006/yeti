      <description>Welcome to SpotiLike My favourite project of em all.
If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for my first attempt in this project(the one which requires config file typing), I suggest you head over to Version 1
Download SpotiLike Source Repo YouTube video What is SpotiLike? SpotiLike is a simple application that allows you to configure custom keyboard shortcuts(hotkeys), that&amp;rsquo;s gonna let you add songs to your private playlists, or your own personal liked songs library in Spotify, while you&amp;rsquo;re listening to them.</description>

      <description>Hi! This is my first attempt in creating &amp;ldquo;an app that would let you save Spotify songs using your keyboard with a custom keyboard shortcut.&amp;rdquo;
It&amp;rsquo;ll be great if you use version 2 since this is boring :/
SpotiLike v1 I&amp;rsquo;ll be going through how to use this only, why and what can be learned if you head over here.
Configuration After installation, the app would auto minimize itself to the System Tray.</description>
