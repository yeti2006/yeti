  <h1>SpotiLike</h1>
  <p>Save Spotify songs to your <b>liked songs library/custom playlists</b> while you're listening to them with your own <b>custom hotkeys</b>!. This project was created mostly based on personal needs but I decided to make this public because it might come useful to some people (specially to gamers)</p>
